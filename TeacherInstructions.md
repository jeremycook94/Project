## Knowledge Required
To use this resource you will need to know how to setup and start the Raspberry Pi. Refer to link below for help using the Raspberry Pi.

## Targeted Curriculum
Key Stage 2

•   Design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by decomposing them into smaller parts

•   Use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output

Key Stage 3

•	Use 2 or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures, design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions

# Objectives
To learn the folliwng:

•	Variables

•	Functions

•	Loops

•	If statements



# Suggested use

I have suggested that this work packet could be used starting with year 4 students however, it could easily be used with higher years, especially the last sections


# Glossary

To try and minimise the amount of reading children need to do, I have included key terms for teachers to explain

##### Variables

----

A variable is defined as a storage location that has an associated name (an identifier), it contains a known or unknown quantity of information also known  as a value.


##### Loops

------
A loop is some code that will keep running until a certain condition happens. In this section we will be using 'for-loops' and 'while loops'.

'For-loops' are  used when you have some code which you want to repeat a number of times.

'While loops', like 'for-loops', are used for repeating sections of code - but unlike a 'for-loop', the 'while loop' will not run  a set number of times, but until a certain condition happens.



##### If-statements
-------
An if-statement allows us to run a certain piece of code when a particular event happens


##### Functions

------

A function lets us use code many times without having to keep typing it. To run the code that is in a function you need to call that function
